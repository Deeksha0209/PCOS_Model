#Extracted data from kaggle. This dataset contains details of PCOS sprawled over various features such as Age, Weight, BMI, Pregnancy etc. We aim to perform EDA to gather insights from our data followed by applying various machine learning algorithms. Then we determine the best algorithm and achieve our predictions for our PCOS model.
